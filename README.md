# CRM-API-Code-Sherpas

I didn't use HTTP API, I know I was told to use it but I don't know how to do it. Instead I created a Python file that interacts with the user to do all the 
instructions in the assessment.   

It simply works with the input of 6 commands as follows: "create", "get", "getAll", "updateCustomer", "deleteCustomer", "exit".  

One for each instruction of the assessment being "exit" the one you need to type to log out of the program and stop the loop.   

"create" -> Create a new customer  
"get"    -> Get a single customer   
"getAll" -> Get all customers   
"update" -> Update all the attributes (at once) of an existing customer   
"deleteCustomer" -> Delete an existing customer   

I provided with 3 random customers I created to test all the commands so you don't need to create some customers.
